## Requirements

You will need to have/install Chrome for testing (https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/), as it is required for this automation. 

For notebook `Selenium-Scrapping.ipynb` to run properly, it is necesary to create a .env file and add:

- **usr**: Illinois email you normally use to log in to UIUC 
- **psw**: Password for UIUC

** -or- ** hard-code these in the notebook (handle your credentials with caution!).

### Libraries needed:

- selenium
- python-dotenv

You can install these libraries in the notebook using pip install, or by running in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
